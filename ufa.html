                                    <h4>Deployment Container</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        <h5>What are Deployment Containers?</h5>
                                        <p>
                                            Deployment Containers are used to compose multiple modules to create Products. 
                                            Deployment Containers have a single responsibility. That is to import all the required modules to build a product and to call the CLI to help in all the tasks from bundling to testing.
                                            Deployment Containers don’t have any code that contributes to a functionality or user interface. In other words they are aggregators and not creators.
                                        </p>
                                        <h5>How many Deployment Containers can a Product have?</h5>
                                        <p>
                                            Every Product has at least one DC. But when you want to separate the code for a true microservices deployment where even the UI code is broken down into multiple parts and deployed along with the backend microservice, we can consider to have multiple DC’s.
                                        </p>
                                    </p>
                                    <br/>
                                    
                                    <h4>Components</h4>
                                    <img class="components-img" src="assets/images/ufa/components.png"/>
                                    <p>
                                        The Components should contain all the non domain specific visual components and helpers, that can be used to create other components and business features.
                                        <h5>What is a component?</h5>
                                        <p>
                                            A component is a discrete bit of the UI that owns one specific 
                                            responsibility and does it well. 
                                            <br/>
                                            There are 2 types of components: non domain specific and
                                            domain specific.
                                        </p>
                                        <h5>What is a non domain specific component?</h5>
                                        <p>
                                            Non domain specific components are baseline UI elements that on their own don’t provide context, but are moldable for different solutions.
                                            Modals, tooltips, inputs and toasts are all good examples of non domain specific components.
                                        </p>
                                    </p>
                                    <br/>
                                    
                                    <h4>Modules and Shared Modules</h4>
                                    <img class="modules-img" src="assets/images/ufa/modules.png"/>
                                    <p>
                                        <h5>What is a Module?</h5>
                                        <p>
                                            Module by itself is a final product, a bounded context 
                                            (http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html). 
                                            
                                            A Module cannot be extended, augmented or changed, but 
                                            another Module can be created that provides the desired 
                                            augmented services or extensions.
                                            
                                            A Module is always domain specific and a deployable unit. 
                                            A user workflow typically involves N Modules. 
                                            The Framework allows seamless navigation across Modules.
                                        </p>
                                        <h5>What is a Shared Module?</h5>
                                        <p>
                                            A Module is deployable and not shareable by default. If you need to share something from a Module, you should create a Shared Module, which is shareable and not deployable and also a bounded context (and a separate package). You can use the Shared Module as a (3rd party) dependency in an other Module.
                                        </p>
                                    </p>
                                    <br/>
                                    
                                    <h4>Theme Module</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        Themes define the look and feel. An application can be configured to have mulitple themes and switching between themes can be done at run time (dynamically).
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Themes are also considered as separate npm packages so that a Deployment Container can compose a Product based on multiple themes with user specific theme selection.</li>
                                            <li>Themes should provide default styles, colors, layouts for all the components, modules and shared modules to use and extend.</li>
                                            <li>Themes should also have capability to override the component/module specific styles to allow fine grained control to Product teams.</li>
                                            <li>Themes should be dynamic and can be changed on the fly without browser refresh.</li>
                                            <li>Handling multiple themes is a requirement in some companies where they want to show a common theme for login for all the products but post-login they want product specific themes.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </p>
                                    <br/>
                                </div>
                            </section>
                            <section id="comp-lib-section" class="doc-section">
                                    <h2 class="section-title">Component Library</h2>
                                    <br/>
                                    <p>Major initial effort is usually concentrated on building the components, this is where companies go wrong. Instead, more effort should be placed on designing/architecting the way to build, share and maintain the components in the initial stages of a library. Later it becomes very easy to build components on pre-defined architecture and share the components in a automatic way. In other words, we need to strive to attain Continuous Release/Delivery, so that all the consumers of these components are notified about new releases and they can upgrade based on the product strategy. 
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Below are some points to consider when building component libraries:</h3>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>CLI to scaffold components.</li>
                                        <li>Version control each component (Follow a versioning protocol like Semantic Versioning 2.0)</li>
                                        <li>CLI to auto build every component into a shareable artifact, test it and auto publish it to the Artifact Repository.</li>

                                        <p>There are 2 kind of dependency handling tasks. One is JavaScript file related and the other is package related.</p>

                                        <p>A package is a collection of reusable code, like an artifact in the Maven world.</p>
                                        <p>There are 2 kind of packages:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Shareable</li>

                                        <p>We need to handle dependencies between JavaScript files for bundling (automatic concatenation).</p>
                                        <p>The recommendation is ES6/7 Modules.</p>

                                        <p>The other kind of dependency management task is to handle dependencies between packages.</p>
                                        <p>The recommendation is npm (https://docs.npmjs.com/).</p>

                                        <p>When you want to share your code, you should share it as a package via npm. We need have a private npm repository, like Nexus or Artifactory for publishing the shareable code and allowing product teams to directly connect and download dependencies.</p>

So before we publish a package to the npm repository, we need to pre-process the source code. This is the bare minimum and a must to be able to share code via npm.</p>

                                        <p>Coding conventions are a set of rules / guidelines for a specific programming language that recommend programming style, practices and methods for each aspect of a piece program written in this language. These conventions usually cover file organization, indentation, comments, declarations, statements, whitespace, naming conventions, programming practices, programming principles, programming rules of thumb, architectural best practices, etc. These are guidelines for software structural quality. Conventions should be formalized in a documented set of rules that an entire team or company follows.</p>

                                    <h3>What is a SDK?</h3>
                                    <p>A software development kit (SDK) is a set of tools used for developing applications provided by hardware and software providers. SDKs are usually comprised of application programming interfaces (APIs), sample code, documentation, etc.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3>Why do we need a SDK?</h3>
                                    <p>From a business perspective, the idea is that a tightly knit development community will serve as a competitive advantage in the marketplace. An example is Apple and the combination of the iPhone and the App Store™. The selection of applications for the iPhone provides a competitive advantage to Apple versus its competitors. In this sense, the device goes from being a commoditized piece of hardware to a platform that other companies need to plugin to. So while the term SDK has been around since the beginning of software, it can often serve as the starting point in an IT company’s business strategy.</p>
    
                                    <h3>How to approach a SDK?</h3>
                                    <p>Below are a few ways to acheive SDK</p>
    
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Modularized Code makes it easy to extend parts of application instead as a whole</li>
                                        <li>Extension Points to most of the moving parts of a application like Services, Controllers etc.</li>
                                        <li>Detailed API Documentation</li>
                                        <li>Scaffolding Tools</li>
                                        <li>Configuration over Code (Metadata based application)</li>
                                        <li>Tools to generate the configuration</li>
                                    </ul>
    
                                    <h3>UI SDK through configuration</h3>
                                    <p>Enterprise Digital Software consists mainly of Forms, Lists and Dashboards. 
                                        So by targeting to make these three major components to be rendered based on Configuration allows us to make the Code comply to CUDM (Customizable, Upgradable, Deployable and Migratable)</p>
                                    
                                    <p>For each component (form, list or dashboard) we need the below</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Registry to register sub-components with their specific configuration</li>
                                        <li>Configuration Interpretor and Renderer</li>
                                        <li>Designer to allow generation of the Configuration through Drag n Drop for super fast development and also this allows us to acheive constrained development</li>
                                    </ul>
    
                                    <p>Also, by using Scaffolding tools we can generate boilerplate code for components, modules, services, themes.</p>
